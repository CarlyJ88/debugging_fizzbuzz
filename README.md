# Debugging in Ruby

Debugging is an important skill, this exercise will give you some practice using two of the main techniques developers use to spot and resolve bugs in their code:

1. Tightening the loop

2. Getting visibility

## Instructions

Clone this repository, and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.

Then run the tests and resolve the errors by `tightening the loop` to identify which line of code is causing the error, then `getting visibility` of what is happening in the code, and resolve the issue.
